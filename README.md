Guessing Game
Randomly generate a number from 1-100. Prompt the user to guess. Continue the game until the user guesses correctly. Include at least two of the following enhancements:

Tell the user whether they are "hot" or "cold" based on proximity to the randomly selected number.
Count the number of guesses and return a response based on that number (i.e. 100 tries: "Are you ever going to get this?").
Keep track of numbers which have been guessed, and mock the user when they guess a number for the second time.
